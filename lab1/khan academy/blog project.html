        <h2 id="sptriptoAs">Spontaneous trip to Astana</h2>
        <h6>posted: 30/12/2022</h6>
        <p>The past twenty-second year has been very difficult for me. There were many difficult moments. That the daily routine, unfulfilled work plans, burning deadlines - all this exhausted me so much. After final exems, I wanted to change the situation.They say that changes heal. With such thoughts, I spontaneously took tickets to Astana on the thirtieth. On New Year's Eve, I was in a completely different city, completely alone among people I didn't know. I remember the last time I was 8-9 years ago, I was here with my grandmother, she loved this city so much. As soon as I arrived in Astana, I went to the embankment. There were a lot of people there, and all with families. In the evening I went to the square where talented citizens were performing. Wonderful people, creative, in beautiful costumes, performed on stage, despite the cold. There were LEDs, a large stage, equipment and people with their relatives enjoying the moment. I stayed there for a week and visited all the places where my grandmother and I were last. I refreshed my thoughts, realized for myself what I want. And with this realization, I returned to my city.</p>

    <p>I was always told as a child that any difficulty makes you stronger. I have remembered this for the rest of my life. Before, maybe I didn't pay attention, but when life hit me in the weakest place, I realized it. I have always been a diligent student at school, studying was my vocation, I loved to study. In the village where I come from, there were no special schools with a physics and mathematics bias. Among the students of my school, I was the smartest. I had big dreams and ambitions. I dreamed of taking it higher. In the final grades, I once shared that I dreamed of entering KBTU, my teachers and friends did not take this idea seriously. That's what motivated me, to show what I'm capable of. I studied hard and as a result entered the university of my dreams. As soon as I entered the university, I was struck by reality. There were so many smart, educated students from different cities from different specialized schools. I had the idea that I would never be able to study and be like other students. In the first semester, we started with programming. This is probably the beginning of my fun life at the university. For the first time in my life, I couldn't get a good grade. But thanks to my efforts, I realized that there is nothing wrong with retakes, the main thing is to save money and teach him even harder the second time!</p>
