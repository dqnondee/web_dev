        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour warm water into a bowl, add salt, dry yeast and a little wheat flour, mix the ingredients so that the loose ones disperse into the liquid.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Knead the dough a little with your hands, adding flour if necessary, and put it back in the bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel and leave it overnight in a warm place. The dough should double in volume. We mince it and proceed to forming bread.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On parchment, greased with vegetable oil, generously pour wheat flour. Spread the dough on the flour. Despite the fact that it seems liquid and soft, but it holds its shape quite well.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> We roll the dough in flour, giving it the shape of a loaf. Transfer the parchment to a baking sheet. We cover the bread preparation with a towel and put it in a warm place for two hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Preheat the oven to 220 degrees. We put the baking tray with the bread preparation in the oven, we need to place fireproof dishes below, pour water into it (I poured water into the second baking tray and put it in the oven two divisions lower) so that the bread rises well, but does not burn.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After 20 minutes of finding bread in the oven, we remove the dishes with water and keep the bread in the oven for about 10 minutes, let it turn brown. We take the bread out of the oven, let it cool down, only after that we cut it into portions. If you start slicing bread hot, the pores in the crumb may give up, the crumb will become dense and lose volume. Ciabatta bread is ready, we serve it to the table as a base for sandwiches or for soup, hot. Enjoy your meal!</p>
